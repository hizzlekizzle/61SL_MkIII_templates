# 61SL_MkIII_templates
A collection of templates to control various synthesizers over MIDI via Novation's 61SL MkIII controller.

The templates contained in the "piedpipers" directory are copied from the community collection located at https://piedpipers.club/sl/templates/ (synced on Aug 12 2023), which are themselves copied from the 61SL Facebook group.

The templates in the "hunterk" directory are my own work to control synths I own that were not included in the factory templates.
